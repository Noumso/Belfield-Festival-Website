## 6. Source Control Management (SCM) & Quality Assurance (QA)

### SCM Strategy

- Repository hosted on **GitHub**.
- Branches:
  - `main` for production code.
  - `dev` for feature integration and testing.
  - `feature/*` branches for individual tasks/features.
- Use **Pull Requests (PRs)** for code review and integration.
- Enforce descriptive commit messages and frequent commits.
- Protect the `main` branch with mandatory PR reviews.

### QA Strategy

- **Unit testing** with Jest for React components and backend logic.
- **API endpoint testing** with Supertest.
- **Manual testing** of key user flows: login, ticket purchase, admin updates.
- **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) to run tests on PRs.
- **Staging environment** deployed for acceptance testing before production release.

---

## 7. Technical Justifications

- **React.js** chosen for its component-driven architecture, responsiveness, and large community support.
- **Node.js with Express** provides a scalable, flexible backend API.
- **MongoDB Atlas** offers a flexible schema design, ideal for artist and ticket data.
- **JWT Authentication** enables secure, stateless session management.
- **Deployment** via Vercel (frontend) and Render or Railway (backend) simplifies hosting and CI/CD.
- **Integration with the Shotgun API** leverages an established ticketing service, reducing development complexity.
