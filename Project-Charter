# 📘 Project Charter – Belfield Festival Website

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

**Purpose:**  
The Belfield Festival Website project aims to provide a professional, responsive, and centralized online platform for the Belfield Association. It will serve as the festival’s official website, helping to increase visibility, streamline communication, and improve the experience for attendees, partners, and organizers.

**SMART Objectives:**
1. Deliver a responsive and user-friendly website showcasing festival details, schedule, and media content by the end of Stage 4.
2. Integrate an admin dashboard allowing content updates (text, images, events) without developer intervention.
3. Enable easy access to the ticketing platform and practical information (location, transport) to reduce information requests by 50%.
